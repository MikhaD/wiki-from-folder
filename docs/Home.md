Welcome to the wiki for wiki-from-folder!

This wiki was generated by this action from documents in the `docs` folder of the repository.

For usage instructions see the [readme](../README.md).

## Options
### `folders`
> default: `docs`

The directory or list of folders to generate the wiki from. If you wish to include multiple directories, separate them with a comma (docs, adr etc.).

### `sidebar`
> default: `true`

Whether or not you wish to generate a custom sidebar with categories based on the subdirectories of the input directory.

### `prefix-files-with-directory`
> default: `false`

Whether or not to prefix file names with the directory they are in. This can be useful if you have multiple files with the same name in different directories, as github wikis completely ignore subdirectories and flatten everything out. Prefixed files will be named dir|filename.ext.

### `branch-to-link-to`
> default: `${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}`

The branch to link to when wiki files link to code, images etc. Defaults to the default branch of the repository.

### `clear-wiki`
> default: `false`

Whether or not to clear the wiki before generating the new files. This is useful if you do not want wiki pages from anywhere other than this action.

### `edit-warning`
> default: `true`

Whether or not to include a warning comment at the top of each generated file telling the viewer not to edit it and pointing them to the source file to edit instead.

## Desired future features
- Option to include additional stuff at the top and bottom of the sidebar
- option to generate index files for directories that have links to all the included files and sub indexes for subdirectories
- Rework formatLinksInFile so it is less reliant on all the parameters of formatLocalLinks
- Add more async for reading and writing files
- Add the ability to detect when a file links to another markdown file in any of the folders being published to the wiki
- Work with other types of files, not just markdown.
