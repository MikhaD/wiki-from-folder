If `sidebar` is set to `true`, the action will generate a sidebar for the wiki based on the directory structure of the source files. Each folder will be a section in the sidebar, and each markdown file will be a link in the sidebar. This is done by creating a custom _Sidebar.md file in the root of the wiki folder, which github uses to display the sidebar.

This is useful because by default github ignores directory structure when generating the sidebar, leading to a flat list of pages that can get quite cluttered.
