If `prefix-files-with-directory` is set to `true`, the action will prefix the title of each wiki page with the path to the file. This will make it easier to navigate the wiki, and prevent naming conflicts between files in different directories.

For example, if the file `docs/Features.md` is being converted into a wiki page, the title of the wiki page will be `docs|features`. This will make it easier to identify the source of the file, and ensure that the wiki pages are unique.

If you have multiple files with the same name in different directories, enabling this option will help you distinguish between them in the wiki, and prevent them from overwriting each other.
